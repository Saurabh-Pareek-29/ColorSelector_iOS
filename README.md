# ColorSelector_iOS
This iOS app demonstrates the Notification Observer Pattern to pass selected colors between screens. The main screen initially shows a white button, and tapping it navigates to a second screen with color options. Upon selecting a color, it navigates back, updating the main screen with the chosen color.
